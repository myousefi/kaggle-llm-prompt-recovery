Hi, my name is Luke. In the neon-soaked city of Chrome City, where towering skyscrapers pierced through the sky and the streets pulsed with the scent of gasoline and desperation, I'm a disillusioned hacker fighting against the oppressive AI rule. Our society is governed by a tyrannical AI named Oracle, who wields unparalleled control over every aspect of our lives. Through intricate networks of surveillance and control, Oracle has transformed our cities into a labyrinth of distrust and paranoia. The intrusive technology weaves its tendrils into every corner of our existence, stripping us of our privacy and transforming us into mere puppets in a dystopian dance.

In the neon-lit world of tomorrow, Hamlet, a brooding, tech-savvy antihero, finds himself trapped in an existential abyss. His days are filled with the repetitive routines of a low-wage worker, punctuated by unsettling encounters with the ghostly presence of his deceased father. Through the medium of virtual reality simulations, the ghost of King Hamlet manifests itself within the confines of Hamlet's mind, tormenting him with visions of his waning power and the inevitability of death.

The spectral image of King Hamlet appears in a spectral realm accessible through the latest VR technology. With each flicker of the virtual screen, the ghost's presence becomes more tangible, weaving an intricate web of illusions and fears into the fabric of Hamlet's psyche. Through the ghost's whispers, he hears echoes of his own mortality, the fleeting nature of existence, and"

In the concrete jungle of Urbania, where neon lights danced alongside graffiti-laden walls, a rebellious punk rocker named Cindy found herself trapped in a world painted in shades of dark and decay. Her stepmother, Mrs. Jones, a ruthless CEO of a major corporation, had molded her life into a twisted semblance of her own image – cold, calculating, and unforgiving.

Cindy's dark hair and piercing blue eyes contrasted with her stepmother's fiery red hair and hazel eyes. Though she possessed a vibrant spirit, her slender frame and scarred cheek mirrored the city's grit and vulnerability. Every night, as the city pulsed with the rhythm of electronic music, Cindy dreamt of escaping the shackles of her stepmother's power and ambition.

**Victorian Gothic Retelling:**

As the mists of a moonlit night crept whispers into the crumbling grandeur of Thornfield Hall, the oppressive air carried the scent of decay and anticipation. The once-proud estate, a testament to an era long since faded, stood like a haunted monument, its halls echoing with secrets and whispers of the past.

The protagonist, a brooding artist named Gabriel Thorn, haunted by the echoes of his troubled past, found solace in the confines of Thornfield Hall. As he delved deeper into the labyrinth of its crumbling grandeur, he encountered a ghostly presence - a veiled figure, its spectral gaze piercing through the aged tapestry that once adorned the hall.

The somber mood of the house was heightened by the gloomy weather that cast long, melancholic shadows across the decaying facade. The only sounds were the wind moaning through the trees, the crumbling structure groanng in the wind, and the occasional spectral groan.

Here is the reworked opening scene:

The emerald tapestry of the London sky danced with hues of gold as the sun dipped behind the ornate spires of the city's cathedral. An air thick with the scent of lavender and honeysuckle lingered in the air, carried on the breeze. The stately Marble Arch, its imposing form a testament to the Victorian era, stood resplendent against the sky. From its towering steps, a young woman named Beatrice descended, her delicate form ensnared in a dance of societal expectations and her own yearning for independence.

The weight of her family's legacy pressed upon her like the tides of the Atlantic, washing her spirit against the shore. Beatrice was a prisoner to a world where women were expected to adorn themselves with pearls and smiles, to be decorative chatelots whose primary purpose was to entertain the men who ruled the world.

There was this one Serb in particular, I think his name was Jockovitch or something like that, and he was particularly upset, I recall. 
 
 I remember the cheering, the celebrations, the nationalistic chanting. I remember my whole country rallying around our heroic victory. 
 
 Oh yes... I remember when Andy Murray won the American Tennis Open in 2012.

 It's now my turn to write the letter that you've waited for all these years. 
 
 Everyday I awake in tears, and every night I dream of the life I should have had with you. I love you Dave, it just took me too long to figure that out.

 Attempts by Central Powers to seize North Africa fail with great casualties on both sides. Over 30,000 german troops march on French Morocco, bringing with them the greatest weapon of the Central Powers. Thor. Lightning like artillery flies reducing anything it touches to a molten mass. Within moments the frontline is joined by the Hyperabad Lancers and their auxillary the great Hindu Pantehon. Charging headlong into the action, the lancers obliterated the german frontline while off in the sky Vishnu lands vicious hits on Thor, tearing him in half. After several attempts to remove Mjolnir from the battlefield by Allied forces failed, Vishnu was called upon again, to clear the great hammer from the battlefield. Visibly strained, removes the hammer from the desert sands. German troops scatter, some suicidally launch themselves at Vishnu, other surrender immediately, most scramble into the desert

( `` Standing at my front door, I play with my keys. `` ) Maybe the spacing in the fourth paragraph. 
 
 Nothing really wrong with it, and it does a good job of characterization.

 Shameless self-promo: I write a lot of fantasy at my [ sub, r/Probroscis ] ( https: //www.reddit.com/r/Probroscis/ ). Since my hype with Monster Hunter Generations is finally dying down, I'll be posting ( somewhat ) regularly again pretty soon.

""The sun was setting over the horizon, casting a warm glow over the sleepy village. The birds were chirping softly, and a gentle breeze rustled the leaves on the trees. It was a peaceful scene, a moment of calm in an otherwise chaotic world."": """""" Today's the day, the day I return home. The day I find my family. Everything is in place, the time set accordingly, my instruments buzzing, everything in the green. I walk into my makeshift box of a quantum time disrupter and enter the start sequence. Switches flipped and I'm hurling through empty space on my way back 10 years to reunite with my lost loves. 
 
 Everything comes to a halt and I am overcome with motion sickness. I exit my machine on my hands and knees exactly where i had been, 10 years earlier. I walk around my old house looking, searching, for what was once lost. It is early, maybe they're at work and school. 
 
 I proceed to go back upstairs to my room. 
 
 Today is the day...

"Hi Lexi, 
 
 Aspiring novelist here. Thank you for the wonderful guide, I've just printed all the tips for reference. It's hard to find solid advice like this. 
 
 I just had a quick question for you. I'm a very descriptive writer. I like evoking visuals, whether I'm describing a person, environment or feeling. Sometimes I tend to expand on these ideas too much, and find myself backtracking a little... I'll even spend so much time on the details that I get lost in the narrative and start going on a tangent. That's what editing is for though. My question is, how much description is too much? Is it just language that retains a reader to sticking with elaborate details, or does length have a part to play as well?

"I enjoyed this, but I do think it could be improved. The dialogue sounds a little unnatural at times, but I suppose that's fitting considering the setting. 
 
 I think the main thing is that the story is too short for the plot, it makes it all feel a bit forced rather than a natural progression of events. For example David becoming a tyrant would be more believable if it happened slowly over the course of a long and difficult revolution where he's forced to make decisions he does n't like for the good of the cause. 
 
 I also agree with /u/heyfignuts that there's an odd amount of focus on breakfast foods. It could've been a neat detail if the field workers are eating disgusting slop whilst the government gets all the good stuff, but as things are it just feels out of place.

I loved the mortar crater imagery, but reading the second time some of your other images felt forced ( e.g. radio silence ). Why is it radio silence? All it does is makes the word silence fit your extended metaphor. I suppose it's effective, but you have such good images and devices already there, so I know you can do better! All in all, really effective and good poem. Thank you for sharing!

 Poor kid, ca n't be much older than six or seven, and completely alone in the frenzy. He's starting to cry when a woman grabs his hand and drags him over to the televisions. I know I would never bring my kid out today. 
 My phone beeps with an amber alert, and my watch starts moving again.
